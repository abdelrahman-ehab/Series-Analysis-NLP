# Naruto TV Series NLP Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive NLP analysis of the *Naruto* anime series. The project is divided into three primary models that explore various aspects of the seriesâ€”from thematic analysis of dialogue to character interaction mapping and specialized classification of ninja techniques.

## Overview

- **Theme Classification:**  
  Leverages zero-shot classification to analyze subtitles from over 200 episodes and extract key dialogue themes.
  
- **Character Network Generator:**  
  Uses NLP and graph libraries to generate a visual network of character interactions from subtitle data.
  
- **Text Classifier:**  
  Scrapes data from online sources and classifies various ninja techniques into distinct categories.

## Models

### 1. Theme Classification

- **Objective:**  
  Classify the dialogue themes from *Naruto* subtitles.
  
- **Approach:**  
  Implements zero-shot classification using Facebook's Large MNLI BART model. Dialogues are classified into the following themes:
  - `friendship`
  - `hope`
  - `battle`
  - `self development`
  - `betrayal`
  - `love`
  - `dialogue`
  

### 2. Character Network Generator

- **Objective:**  
  Generate a network graph illustrating character interactions based on subtitle dialogues.
  
- **Approach:**  
  Utilizes NLP libraries (NLTK, spaCy, spaCy Transformers) in conjunction with graph libraries (NetworkX and Pyvis) to construct and visualize the character network.
  


### 3. Text Classifier

- **Objective:**  
  Classify various ninja techniques scraped from *Naruto* fandom pages.
  
- **Approach:**  
  Employs web scraping (Scrapy, Beautiful Soup) to collect data and uses the `distilbert-base-uncased` model from Hugging Face Transformers to categorize techniques into:
  - `ninjutsu`
  - `taijutsu`
  - `genjutsu`
  

## Dependencies

Each model has its own set of dependencies:

- **Theme Classification:**
  - Hugging Face Transformers (BART for MNLI)
  - PyTorch or TensorFlow
  
- **Character Network Generator:**
  - NLTK
  - spaCy & spaCy Transformers
  - NetworkX
  - Pyvis
  
- **Text Classifier:**
  - Scrapy
  - Beautiful Soup
  - Hugging Face Transformers (DistilBERT)

Please refer to the individual notebooks for the full list of requirements and installation commands.

## Data Sources

- **Subtitles:**  
  Subtitle files for over 200 episodes of *Naruto* are used for theme classification and character network generation.
  
- **Web Scraping:**  
  Data for classifying ninja techniques is scraped from *Naruto* fandom website.
