It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",

Orochimaru and tests!\\n Why are you suddenly saying such things?\\n I have to explain it to you from when Orochimaru left the village.\\n Over ten years ago,\\n Orochimaru\\u2019s desire to satisfy his own inquiring mind and further his power\\n was such that he gradually exceeded the scope of a Shinobi\\n and in the end, got involved in developing what are called Forbidden Jutsu.\\n How unfortunate.\\n Naturally, this soon became known to the village.\\n After Orochimaru!\\n Stop that guy!\\n But Orochimaru, who traveled in and out of country on missions\\u2026\\n had several other private facilities outside of the Leaf Village\\u2026\\n So one of those is on Demon Island?\\n So, the people who disappeared?\\n They were used for human experiments.\\n What?\\n Damn Orochimaru! What does he think people are?\\n So, what are we going to do?\\n It\\u2019s obvious, isn\\u2019t it? We get into their hideout!\\n And we have to get lsaribi back!\\n It\\u2019s settled.\\n We\\u2019ll continue and hit the Demon of the Ocean\\u2019s hideout.\\n Sensei, how long have you known about Demon Island?\\n It\\u2019s because Orochimaru was the Jonin in charge of me.\\n Huh?\\n Tell me when we get close to the island.\\n The pain is gradually getting stronger.\\n Somebody\\u2019s coming.\\n What shall we do?\\n Do as you please.\\n Yes.\\n The arrogance\\u2026 One day I\\u2019ll pay him back!\\n This way.\\n Hurry!\\n How is it, Shino?\\n No problem.\\n Okay!\\n So, a collection ship is on the move, huh?\\n Just the right time.\\n Good work, I was right to send you back to Mother Island.\\n What\\u2019s wrong? You\\u2019re pale.\\n When will I return to normal?\\n Like you said, I\\u2019ve gathered information about the ships\\n from the market and the village, even the attacks.\\n So\\u2026\\n What are you bringing up, Isaribi?\\n You can\\u2019t possibly have forgotten your role as a prototype.\\n As a converted body, your cooperation in generating data\\u2026\\n That was one of the conditions of the promise.\\n Don\\u2019t worry, we\\u2019ll soon be done getting data from you.\\n I\\u2019ll keep the promise\\u2026 as long as I don\\u2019t change my mind.\\n You understand, right?\\n Yes.\\n Well, if you understand, go keep our guests company.\\n I understand\\u2026\\n You\\u2019re vicious, too.\\n There\\u2019s no sign of \\u2018em.\\n What is this?\\n Birds, no fish?\\n Don\\u2019t move!\\n Too bad, isn\\u2019t it?\\n Don\\u2019t mess with Shinobi from the Leaf Village. 134.01\\t02:26:06:15\\t02:26:07:19\\tYou, little\\u2026!\\n Well, well, aren\\u2019t these cute kitties?\\n Is everyone okay?\\n Yep.\\n As always, you people are addicted to peace.\\n You\\u2019re from last evening!\\n Your face looks familiar.\\n The Chunin Exams, if I remember correctly.\\n That\\u2019s right\\u2026\\n As I recall, Sasuke\\u2019s adversary!\\n The guy who was with that Kabuto?!\\n You are correct\\u2026\\n Of course, I haven\\u2019t seen him since then.\\n You used a strange Jutsu to suck up other\\u2019s Chakras.\\n You\\u2019re the guy who sucked up all of Sasuke\\u2019s strength.\\n Well, all of you, come at me. I\\u2019m different than I was then.\\n Okay, I\\u2019ll finish you off right now!\\n Wait, Naruto!\\n Shino?\\n You go ahead. Seems like I\\u2019m the opponent for him.\\n Huh?\\n His Jutsu is not suited for your style of close combat.\\n We can\\u2019t have all three of us stay here.\\n All right.\\n \\u2013 We\\u2019re counting on you, Shino! \\u2013 Be careful!\\n Wait!\\n Parasitic Insects, eh?\\n Found \\u2018im!\\n Who?\\n Welcome, or should I say, haven\\u2019t seen you in a while?\\n It\\u2019s you, Amachi.\\n I\\u2019m surprised!\\n I can\\u2019t believe you\\u2019ve come back after something like that happened\\u2026\\n Like what?\\n You don\\u2019t remember?\\n Sorry, but I have no business with you\\u2026\\n Where is Orochimaru?\\n Orochimaru?\\n Don\\u2019t play dumb. He\\u2019s here, isn\\u2019t he?\\n A Curse Mark responds even though the operator isn\\u2019t around\\u2026\\n Stuff like that happens huh?\\n True, Orochimaru was here\\u2026\\n But that was over half a month ago.\\n No way.\\n It doesn\\u2019t matter if you don\\u2019t believe me.\\n So the pain I felt so far\\u2026\\n has been the influence of Orochimaru\\u2019s presence here half a month ago?\\n Wait a minute.\\n Sensei!\\n You two!\\n Oh my, you brought Genin.\\n Anko, you\\u2019re all grown up\\u2026\\n Who is that?\\n Amachi\\u2026 a Medical Ninja who partnered with Orochimaru,\\n and was running various experiments here.\\n Orochimaru\\u2019s not here.

Shut up, shut up!\\n Stop it! Are you bullying me, too?\\n No\\u2026 I-I\\u2019m the same as you!\\n You\\u2019re lying!\\n What are you talking about?

Let me go, let me go!\\n That\\u2019s dirty of you!\\n What are you talking about?\\n There are no such things as being too dirty or crappy for Shinobi.\\n And you call yourself a Ninja?\\n Shut up!\\n What?\\n This place is collapsing.\\n They\\u2019re planning to take care of us along with the building.\\n Oh, you\\u2019ve gotta be kidding me!\\n Hurry, the entrance is already useless.\\n I thought this place would be traced soon.\\n It\\u2019s an old building,\\n but a damn good tomb for the likes of them.\\n One person didn\\u2019t make it in time?\\n Oh well, doesn\\u2019t have much of an influence on attacking a collection ship.\\n Damn!

All you\\u2019re doing is slugging it out.\\n This is what ends up happening when two guys get together.\\n That\\u2019s right.\\n Anyway, this isn\\u2019t the time to be acting carefree like that.\\n Lady Tsunade is calling for you.\\n Grandma Tsunade?\\n What does she want?\\n Ninja Dropouts?\\n Yeah. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNinja Dropouts are\\n Rogue Ninja who, of their own free will,\\n choose not to be Shinobi and leave their respective villages to join up.\\n They\\u2019re a gang of thieves who use brutal and villainous means to steal.\\n That\\u2019s horrible\\u2026using their abilities as Ninja for criminal purposes.\\n That\\u2019s unforgivable.\\n One of their members was captured yesterday\\n in Ogi Pass in the Land of Forests.\\n This guy is the only member\\n whose wanted notice is circling around the lands.\\n He was found wandering about and taken prisoner.\\n His name is Gantetsu.\\n For a former Ninja, that\\u2019s pretty lame.\\n Gantesu is being taken to the capital city of the Land of Forests\\n in order to do an exhaustive investigation into this matter\\n for the purpose of wiping out the Ninja Dropouts\\u2026\\n However, there is a possibility that the Ninja Dropouts will try\\n to rescue him along the way\\u2026\\n A police escort has been sent from the capital\\n so it is fully prepared for the convoy.\\n But since the opponents are ex-Ninja,\\n the idea is that Shinobi would be the best countermeasure for Shinobi,\\n so they requested that the Leaf Village also send out some Ninja.\\n That\\u2019s what this request is all about.\\n I\\u2019m getting excited! I\\u2019ll show \\u2018em how great Leaf Ninja are!\\n \\u2013Got it! \\u2013Let\\u2019s give it a shot!\\n All right!

I\\u2019m an injured man! Treat me with a little more care!\\n Oh yeah, that\\u2019s right!\\n All I was thinking about at that time was protecting someone I cared about\\u2026\\n What I\\u2019m capable of doing right now\\u2026\\n I was thinking\\u2026\\n What?\\n There are many variables such as mission level,\\n or platoon\\u2019s member structure\\u2026\\n But no matter how small a platoon might be,\\n I think it\\u2019s important to assign one Medical Ninja to it\\u2026\\n I know that already\\u2026\\n I wrote exactly the same thing in a report long ago\\n regarding the survival rate and mission achievement rate of small platoons.\\n But it\\u2019s not that easy to nurture Medical Ninja.\\n They require a different set of skills than that of fighting types Ninja\\u2026\\n The minute perfection of Chakra control,\\n the ability to assimilate a huge volume of specialized knowledge,\\n the brains to apply that in a broad way\\u2026 patience\\u2026\\n And there is the most important thing\\n for Shinobi who are to develop into a Medical Ninja\\u2026\\n Well, I\\u2019m busy right now, so\\u2026\\n The most important thing\\u2026huh?\\n Hidden Leaf Hospital \\t\\t I\\u2019m all wrapped up in bandages again\\u2026\\n This way I can\\u2019t even hold chopsticks\\u2026\\n Sakura, when it\\u2019s time for my meal, feed me, okay?\\n I\\u2019ll open up my mouth just like this and\\u2026\\n Huh?

Believe it!\\n There\\'s a problem, sir!\\n Lord Hokage!\\n What is it?\\n Did that Naruto do something again?\\n Yes. He climbed onto the Mountainside Images…\\n And he vandalized and graffitied all over them!\\n Wait!\\n Ha ha…\\n Why should I?\\n Hey, Naruto!\\n How did you suddenly get here, lruka Sensei?\\n The question is what are you doing here when you should be in class now?\\n Now listen, Naruto.\\n You failed the last graduation test and the one before that.\\n This is no time to be goofing off, you fool!\\n We will have a re-test on the Transformation Jutsu!\\n Even those who already passed will take it!\\n Whaaaat?!\\n Sakura Haruno. Here I go…\\n Transform!\\n OK!\\n I did it!\\n Cha!\\n Did you see that, Sasuke?\\n Next, Sasuke Uchiha.\\n Yes.\\n O-OK.\\n Next, Naruto Uzumaki.\\n This is a real pain.\\n And it\\'s all your fault.\\n Like I care!!\\n OK…\\n Good luck, Naruto…\\n Transform!\\n How was it?\\n I call it the \"Sexy Jutsu\"!\\n You fool! Stop making idiotic spells!\\n Darn…\\n Darn…\\n I won\\'t let you go home unless you clean that all up.\\n I don\\'t care…\\n There\\'s nobody home anyway.\\n Naruto...\\n What is it this time?\\n What I meant was…\\n If you clean up all that mess, I\\'ll buy you ramen tonight.\\n Huh?!\\n Yes! I-I will finish it no time!\\n Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!\\n Naruto.\\n Why did you vandalize those faces?\\n Don\\'t you know who the Hokage leaders are?\\n Of course, I do!\\n I know they earned the title Lord Hokage\\n because they were the best Ninja of their time, right?\\n Especially the Fourth Hokage was a hero\\n who saved the village from the nine-tail demon fox.\\n Then why did you do that?\\n Because I\\'ll become a Hokage myself.\\n And I\\'ll be the greatest Hokage of all time!\\n So that everyone will finally learn to accept me!\\n By the way, Sensei, I have a favor to ask.\\n You want another bowl?\\n Mmmm…No…\\n Can I borrow that Leaf headband for a while?\\n This?\\n No no!\\n This is worn only by those who have graduated from Ninja Academy.\\n Tomorrow, you will…\\n You\\'re so mean!\\n So that\\'s why you took off your goggles…\\n Humph... One more bowl please!\\n We are now about to begin the graduation test.\\n When your name is called, proceed to the next classroom.\\n The test is on the Clone Jutsu.\\n Oh no…\\n Of all the…! That is my weakest Jutsu!\\n But still… I will do it no matter what!\\n Clone Jutsu!\\n Disqualified!\\n Iruka Sensei.\\n His physical coordination and stamina are excellent.\\n And he managed to come up with something.\\n Isn\\'t that enough for him to pass?\\n Mizuki Sensei... All the others created three or more clones.\\n Naruto created just one.\\n And it\\'s practically useless. I can\\'t give him a passing mark.\\n I \\'m a Ninja now!\\n You did well. That\\'s my son.\\n Congratulations for your graduation.\\n I\\'ll cook something good tonight!\\n Look at that one.\\n It\\'s that boy. I hear he\\'s the only one who failed.\\n Serves him right.\\n Imagine what would happen if he became a Ninja.\\n Isn\\'t that the boy who is actually…\\n Hey! We\\'re not supposed to talk about that.\\n Iruka. We need to talk later.\\n Yes, sir.\\n Iruka Sensei isn\\'t trying to be mean to you.\\n Then why only me?\\n He wants you to become strong from the bottom of his heart.\\n You both don\\'t have parents.\\n But I really wanted to graduate.\\n Heh... I guess I have no choice…\\n I\\'ll let you in on a big secret.\\n Secret?\\n Iruka.\\n What is it, Lord Hokage?\\n I know how you feel. But…\\n Naruto also grew up without knowing the love of his parents…like you.\\n Let me go!\\n My mom and dad are still out there fighting!\\n Wake up, Iruka Sensei!\\n What\\'s the matter?\\n Come to Lord Hokage\\'s immediately!\\n I heard that Naruto… stole the Scroll of Sealing.\\n The Scroll of Sealing?!\\n Let\\'s see…\\n The first Jutsu is… Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu?\\n What?! Already a Jutsu I\\'m no good at?\\n Lord Hokage! We can\\'t forgive him!\\n This is not just a prank!\\n The Scroll is a dangerous item that the First Hokage sealed!\\n Depending on its use…\\n It will be a major disaster if it is taken out of the village!\\n Yes. Bring Naruto here at once!\\n Yes, sir!\\n Where did you go…Naruto?\\n I will tell everyone in the village about this and eliminate Naruto…\\n Then the Scroll of Sealing will be mine!\\n Hey you, Naruto!\\n You found me..\\n And I\\'ve only learned one Jutsu.\\n He\\'s been practicing the Jutsu…\\n until he\\'s become this exhausted and dirty…?\\n Listen, listen! I\\'m gonna show you this amazing Jutsu!\\n You\\'re gonna let me graduate if I can do it!\\n Isn\\'t it true that I can graduate if I can do one of the Jutsu written here?\\n Who told you that?\\n Mizuki Sensei. He told me about this scroll, and this place…\\n Mizuki did?!\\n I\\'m impressed you found this place.\\n I see now…how it is.\\n Naruto, give me that scroll.\\n Wait, wait… What\\'s going on here?\\n Naruto! Never give him that scroll!\\n It is a dangerous object that contains forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed.\\n Mizuki used you in order to get it for himself!\\n W-Wha--?\\n Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of you holding that scroll!\\n Huh?\\n What are you saying, Mizuki! Don\\'t let him fool you, Naruto!\\n I will tell you the truth.\\n Idiot! Don\\'t do that!\\n After an incident 12 years ago, a rule was created.\\n A rule?\\n That is, Naruto, a rule everybody but you knows.\\n Except me?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat is it?\\n Stop it, Mizuki!\\n The rule forbids anyone from revealing that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit!\\n Huh?\\n You are actually the Demon, Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,\\n who killed Iruka\\'s parents and destroyed our village!\\n Stop it!\\n Everyone has been deceiving you ever since.\\n Didn\\'t you find it strange?\\n Why everyone hated you so much?\\n No! No! No! No! No!\\n Naruto…\\n Nobody accepts you. That\\'s why Iruka hates you so much!\\n Iruka... Naruto grew up without the love of parents.\\n Everyone avoids him like the plague after what happened.\\n That\\'s why he keeps misbehaving.\\n It\\'s the only way for him to get any attention or acknowledgement.\\n He pretends to be tough, but inside he is really hurting.\\n Die, Naruto!\\n Naruto! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGet down!\\n Why…?\\n Because you and I are the same.\\n After my parents died,\\n nobody paid attention to me or gave me any support.\\n I wasn\\'t a good student in school.\\n I was the class clown… because I wanted people to notice me.\\n I couldn\\'t get noticed through excellence, so I kept doing stupid things.\\n It was so hard.\\n Isn\\'t that right, Naruto?\\n You felt so lonely…right? And you suffered inside, right?\\n I\\'m sorry, Naruto….\\n If I had been more responsible, maybe you wouldn\\'t have suffered so much.\\n Don\\'t make me laugh!\\n Iruka has always hated you, ever since you killed his parents!\\n He\\'s just saying all that to get the Scroll of Sealing back!\\n Naruto!\\n Narutoooooo!\\n He is not the type of kid who will change his mind.\\n He will take revenge against our village using that scroll!\\n Didn\\'t you see his eyes? Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox.\\n No… Naruto…isn\\'t…like that at all!\\n All I want is to kill Naruto and get the scroll.\\n I\\'ll take care of you later!\\n I-I won\\'t let you…\\n Well, well.\\n Mizuki has a big mouth!\\n Naruto feels worse than he\\'s ever felt.\\n He might unleash the power locked up inside him.\\n The Scroll of Sealing is now with him.\\n There\\'s a slight chance he might actually release\\n the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit sealed inside him!\\n If that happens…\\n I\\'ve found him!\\n Naruto!\\n Everything that Mizuki said was a lie!\\n Give me that scroll, quick! Mizuki is after the scroll!\\n It can\\'t be…\\n Why is it, Naruto?\\n How…\\n did you know I wasn\\'t Iruka…?\\n Because I\\'m Iruka.\\n I see.\\n What\\'s in it for you to protect the one who killed your family?\\n I\\'m not gonna let a stupid idiot like you get that scroll!\\n You\\'re the idiot. Naruto is the same as me.\\n Same?\\n Anyone can do whatever he wants once he has the scroll.\\n There is no way that that monster…\\n that Fox Spirit, won\\'t take advantage of the power of that scroll!\\n You\\'re right…\\n I guess it was true all along!\\n See, Iruka Sensei never really cared for me at all!\\n ...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n But Naruto is different!\\n I know that he is an exceptional student.\\n He works very hard,\\n and he\\'s single-minded and clumsy at the same time.\\n No one accepts him, but he knows the meaning of human suffering.\\n He is not the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n He\\'s Naruto Uzumaki of the Village Hidden in the Leaves!\\n You are so gullible. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlruka!\\n I was gonna take you down later, but I have changed my mind.\\n Die!\\n I guess this is the end for me…\\n Naruto?!\\n You surprised me there, freak.\\n If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I\\'ll kill you!\\n Shut up! I can take care of a kid like you with a single blow!\\n Why don\\'t you try then? I\\'ll strike you back a thousand-fold!\\n Let\\'s see you try! Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!\\n Shadow Clone Jutsu!\\n Naruto! You\\'ve…\\n Those aren\\'t just images but actual clones! That\\'s an advanced Ninjutsu!\\n What\\'s this…?\\n What\\'s the matter? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tC\\'mon!\\n Weren\\'t you gonna get me with one blow? Here!\\n In that case… I\\'ll come to you.\\n I kinda got carried away. lruka Sensei, are you okay?\\n Yeah.\\n He\\'s really something.\\n Maybe it is true.\\n Maybe he will surpass all the Hokage leaders…\\n Naruto, come over here. I\\'d like to give you something.\\n Has anyone found Naruto yet?\\n No.\\n Darn, this is going to be bad…\\n There\\'s no need to worry anymore.\\n Lord Hokage!\\n He\\'ll be back soon.\\n Sensei, how much longer?\\n OK, you may open your eyes now.\\n Congratulations…on your graduation.\\n In celebration, we\\'ll have ramen tonight!\\n Iruka Sensei!\\n That hurts!\\n Naruto…\\n I was going to lecture to you...\\n that the road gets more difficult now that you\\'re a Ninja.\\n But I guess I\\'ll just wait to tell you that until we get to the ramen stand…\\n W-What do you want, you little shrimp? Quit following me!\\n You\\'re smaller than me and\\n you\\'re saying that you\\'re gonna become the Fifth Hokage?\\n I don\\'t care if you are the 3rd Hokage\\'s grandson or not.\\n It\\'s not that easy to be a Hokage!\\n If you want it that bad, you\\'re gonna have to beat me first!\\n Next episode:  \"My Name Is Konohamaru!\"\\n Watch my outstanding performance!\\n'"
